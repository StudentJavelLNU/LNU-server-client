## Communication basiscs

* Media and signals
* Asynchronous and synchronous communication
* Relationships among bandwidth, throughput and noise
* Frequency-division and time-division multiplexing


## Networking and network technologies

* Packat switching
* Framing, parity and error detection
* Local and wide area technologies
* Network addressing
* Connection and extension(repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches)
* Topologies and wiring (star, ring, bus)
* Next-hop forwarding
* Shortest path communication
* Measures of delay and throughput
* Protocol layers


## Internets and internetworking

* Motivation and concept
* Internet Protocal (IP) datagram format and addressing
* Internet routers and routing
* Address binding (ARP)
* Internet controll messages (ICMP)
* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
* Transmission COntrol Protocol (TCP)


## Network applications

* Domain name system (DNS)
* File transfer (FTP)
* Remote login (TELNET)
* Email transfer (SMTP)


## What a network includes

* Transmission hardware
  * Some kind of hardware that controlls and sends in the media
  * Control transmission
  * Run protocol software
* Protocol software
  * Encodes and formats data
  * Detects and corrects problems


## Internet today

* The curve are not as steap now as it was before.
* Growing out of IPv4 addresses.
* Internet of things, maybe will increase the curve again.


## What a network does

* Provides communication that is:
  * Fair
  * Reliable
  * Efficient
  * From one application to another
* Automatically detects and corrects
  * Data corruption
  * Data loss
  * Duplication
  * Out-of-order deliviery
* Automatically finds optimal path from source to destination
