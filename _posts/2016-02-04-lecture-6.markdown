### Python

{% highlight python %}

import socket

socket.gethostbyname('mymoodle.lnu.se')

{% endhighlight %}


## ARP

Give me your ip address

* Broadcasting, shouts out to the network, -give me your ip adresses
* Caching, 
* Soft state

{% highlight bash %}

arp -a

{% endhighlight %}


### ICMP


### NAT, Network Address Translation

* IPv6, no NAT, end-to-end connections for all devices. 128-bit addresses.
* IPv4, 2*32 addresses, 4.4 billion address
* We have run out of IPv4 addresses.
* We find new ways to handle this, by NAT for example
* IPv6, IPsec
* Ignore IPv5, some kind of streaming protocol.

### IPv6
* 128 Bits long addresing
* xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
* Written as groups of 2B, four hex
* Leading zeros may be dropped
* If ...::... then assume that ist 0 between the ::
* No need for NAT, all devices can be addressed
*

![ipv6addressimg](https://teknikpappan.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ipv6.jpg)

* Unicast
  * Identify a specific host accress the internet
  * Globally routable
  * Highest order bits are 001
* Multicast
  * Deliver to an entire group of hosts
* Anycast
  * Deliver to any one of a group of hosts
  * Only cares about one response
  * Deliverd to all machines, but needs one response

### IPv6 multicast addresses

### Link-layer protocols

[NPD, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol)

* DHCP, ARP, ..., is integrated into IPv6
* NDP, Neighbor Discovery Protocol
  * Used to discover other hosts and routers on a local network
  * Incerporates many features from older link-layer protocols


### Special addresses used by NDP



* All host multicast
  * FF02::1
* All router multicast
  * FF02::2

### Neigbor solicitation

* NS message, ICMPv6 (type 135)
* IPv6 addresses
  * Source, unspecified (zeros)

### IPv6 headers

![ipv6header](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk648/tk872/images/technologies_white_paper0900aecd8054d37d-03.jpg)

* IPv6 header size: 40B

IPv4 vs IPv6:
* Designed primarily to speed up routing.
* No checksum.
* No fragmentation.
* TTL name change to reflect "hop count".

#### Optional headers

![nextheaderoptional](http://www.zytrax.com/images/ipv6_headers.gif)

* "Next header" can point to another header
* This other header can include authentication details



## HTTP Protocol

* URI, Uniform Resource Identifier
* HTML, HyperText Markup Language
* HTTP, HyperText Transfer Protocol
  * Client-server protocol for transferring recources
  * Client sends request and server sends response

* Important properties:
  *
